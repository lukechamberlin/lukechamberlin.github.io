This is the Workspace Delete Tool with a Soteria Logo. 

In order to work properly, the 'LogoSoteria.png' needs to be saved in 'C:/Windows/'

The RCMworkspace folder needs to be set as 'C:/RCMworkspace'.

The RCM Application needs to be closed before you delete the RCMworkspace folder.

Thanks!
